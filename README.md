This is a **workout tracking application**. This project was created as part of [The Complete Javascript Course  2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by *Jonas Schmedtmann*.

The majority of the HTML/CSS foundation was developed by the course instructor. The Javascript was written by me alongside the instructor as part of the course.

## Test out the application!

- Make sure to allow the application to have access to your current location
- Click on the map to initiate a new workout log
- Choose between running and cycling!
- Try editing or deleting a previously logged workout with the buttons on the top right of the workout
- Try clearing all workouts with the button at the bottom of the log
- Try reloading the browser to confirm your workouts are preserved

### This application features the following:

- **Object Oriented Programming** -- entire application is written OOP style
- **API Usage** -- real-world map API thanks to [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/SlavaUkraini/)

### Features I implemented independently:

- Ability to edit a workout
- Ability to delete a workout
- Ability to delete all workouts
- Feedback message that appears after new workout successfully created
